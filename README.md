# Oxidize Game Engine ðŸ¦€

> Where Rust meets gaming, and things get deliberately oxidized!

## About

Oxidize is an ambitious, high-performance game engine written in Rust, designed to revolutionize game development through memory safety, zero-cost abstractions, and blazingly fast performance. Just like how iron oxidizes to form a stronger, more resilient surface, Oxidize builds upon Rust's robust foundation to create something truly extraordinary.

## Features ðŸš€

- **Memory-Safe Architecture**: Leverage Rust's ownership system for leak-free game development
- **ECS Core**: Built on a modern Entity Component System for optimal performance
- **Cross-Platform**: Target multiple platforms with minimal configuration
- **Hot Reloading**: Iterate quickly with dynamic asset and code reloading
- **Modern Graphics**: Support for cutting-edge graphics APIs
- **Physics Integration**: Robust physics simulation capabilities
- **Asset Pipeline**: Efficient asset management and loading

## Status

ðŸ”¨ Currently under active development - Watch this space oxidize into something amazing!

## Modules
- core: Main engine logic
- rendering: Rendering pipeline details
- vfx: Visual effects components

## Building

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Getting Started

```rust
// Example coming soon - Currently forging the core systems!
```

## Why "Oxidize"?

Because sometimes you need to let your code rust properly to build something strong! ðŸ’ª
